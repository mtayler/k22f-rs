# k22f
This crate provides an autogenerated API for access to FRDM-K22F peripherals.
The API is generated using [svd2rust] with SVD files from
[Keil Device Family Packs].

## Usage

The `rt` feature is optional and brings in support for `cortex-m-rt`.

In your code:

```rust
use k22f;

let mut peripherals = k22f::Peripherals::take().unwrap();
let gpioa = &peripherals.GPIOA;
<!-- gpioa.odr.modify(|_, w| w.odr0().set_bit()); -->
```
